## Rules
This is the game, where a player clicks on two cards one by one, and if they match - they stay opened. If not - they turn over again. The rating is from 1 to 3 stars and loses one star after 20 moves and second star after 30 moves. Pressing "restart" icon restarts the game. Have fun!


## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
